    working directory 
3. Type "make"

    or the relative filepath. There are two text files in the subproject_1 
    directory for you to use, "ANNA_KARENINA.txt" and "big.txt".

    does not matter.

2. Make the directory "subproject_2" located in the IPC directory the current 
    working directory 
3. Type "make"            
4. This program requires two additional command line arguments, so you will 
    need to execute the program with the following command:
    "./subproject_2 <filename> <keyword>"
6. The program execution will output the lines of the file containing the 
    keyword to standard output.
